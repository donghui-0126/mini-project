Brand/Name regressor and Color regressor loss is very big. (250,000)

i think two model's loss function should be changed. 

1. huber loss
huber loss is less senstive at outlier data. 

2. L1 loss
same reason 

3. Kfold should be shuffled
My datasets are grouped in brand order. 
Therefore, if you shuffle it, the performance can be improved.


Do next coding
1. kfold parameter: shuffle=True
2. change lgbm regressor's loss function
3. change feed-forward netword's loss function

And, I 'm ganna eriment with several models.
1. https://www.kaggle.com/code/ifeanyinneji/keras-cnn-model-classify-nike-and-adidas-shoes 
2. VGG net



2/13

all regressor performance is very low. (rmse is more than 150,000)


so, i have two method.

1. change model dnn to lgbm
2. method 1 is faild, i crawling again to get color image. 

and make only one model that use CNN.
