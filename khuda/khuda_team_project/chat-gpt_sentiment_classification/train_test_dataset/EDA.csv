That was a good one  For a second there  I was like   whoa  ,joy
i feel as confused about life as a teenager or as jaded as a year old man,fear
i now feel compromised and skeptical of the value of every unit of work i put in,fear
i am feeling completely overwhelmed i have two strategies that help me to feel grounded pour my heart out in my journal in the form of a letter to god and then end with a list of five things i am most grateful for,fear
i remember feeling acutely distressed for a few days,fear
i was stymied a little bit as i wrote feeling unsure that i might go somewhere with the story unintended,fear
i feel like we are pressured into being young beautiful thin and depending on the trend having the girls rejuvenated or butt implants,fear
i began having them several times a week feeling tortured by the hallucinations moving people and figures sounds and vibrations,fear
i will be able to lay on my bed in the dark and not feel terrified at least for a while,fear
i had begun to feel apprehensive when thick black rain clouds stormed into the sky above town,fear
i had stated to her the reason i feel so fearful is because i feel unsafe,fear
i didn t feel like getting shaken down by the tsa quite yet so i pulled off to the side at creative croissants for a lunch,fear
i think if a poem doesn t put pressure on me i don t feel uncomfortable in the sense of feeling more than i can feel understanding more than i can understand loving more than i am able to be in love,fear
i suppose he feels badly because he was a bit skeptical of her pain over the last few months shes had a hyperchondria and exaggeration habit in the past though he never openly questioned her about it,fear
i told him that maybe i just need time to think how ive been feeling indecisive about things lately,fear
i remember feeling really terrified when i was in brazil on a bus that was going up steep mountain hills on the side of the mountain in the middle of a big storm wondering if we were going to fall off,fear
i feel strange coming back to work after my one day holiday,fear
im getting the feeling that my classes are a little intimidated by the concept of a lit,fear
when i heard a rumour that the st year exam results were out i had fear that i might be one of the failures,fear
i specifically wanted tango was feeling shy and maks quite the opposite hard to get far enough away from him to get good pics lol,fear
i also didn t feel very weird sleeping in my bed while the two of them slept in hers,fear
i feel vulnerable and alone,fear
i think im just being stupid feeling nervous,fear
i feel now so uncomfortable with all of them i guess is me,fear
i wonder sometimes whether i have just added to the antagonism and misunderstanding that many people have towards those of us who feel reluctant to wholeheartedly support the traditional armistice day remembrances,fear
i know its an unfair reaction but i have run out of ways to explain how i feel shaken is the best i can come up with right now,fear
i am feeling pretty restless right now while typing this,fear
i just feel terrified like im on the edge of a precipice staring ahead,fear
